I started my studies at Codecool Budapest in 2018. During that time I was able to contribute myself to various projects and teams. The basic idea of Codecool is ownership in a way that every member can and should implement the ability to learn new technologies. The ones which I'm familiar with: Python, SQL, JavaScript, Java, Go, ORM technologies and React.
